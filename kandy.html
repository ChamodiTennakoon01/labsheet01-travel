                    Kandy, a picturesque city nestled in Sri Lanka's central highlands, was the last capital of the
                    ancient Sinhalese kingdom and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. </p>

                <p>Renowned for its lush greenery, mist-covered hills, and serene lakes, Kandy offers a unique blend of
                    natural beauty and cultural heritage. Visitors can explore historical sites, lush botanical gardens,
                    and vibrant markets while enjoying the cool hill country climate. </p>

                <p>Central to Kandy's cultural heritage is the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), a
                    Buddhist temple located within the Royal Palace Complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy. This temple
                    houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha, a significant religious artifact believed to grant
                    governance over the country to its possessor, historically held by Sinhalese kings. Bhikkhus from
                    the Malwathu and Asgiri chapters conduct daily worship in the temple's inner chamber, with rituals
                    performed at dawn, noon, and evening. On Wednesdays, a symbolic bathing of the relic called Nanumura
                    Mangallaya is conducted using a herbal preparation made from scented water and fragrant flowers,
                    believed to have healing powers and distributed to attendees. The temple's golden-roofed structure
                    is an architectural marvel, and visitors can explore not only the main temple but also smaller
                    temples, shrines, and museums within the complex.</p>
