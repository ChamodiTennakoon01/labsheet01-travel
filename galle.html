                <p>
                    Nestled on the southern coast of Sri Lanka, the enchanting city of Galle is a treasure trove of
                    history and charm. The heart of Galle is the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Galle Fort, a magnificent
                    Dutch fort that has stood since the early 16th century. This colonial-era fort is surrounded by
                    thick stone walls and offers a glimpse into a 300-year-old Dutch atmosphere, with its well-preserved
                    architecture and historical buildings remaining untouched by modern skyscrapers.</p>
                <p>Within the fort's walls, life moves leisurely, allowing visitors to soak in the beautiful colonial
                    buildings and the
                    rich history that permeates the area. Beyond the fort, Galle has grown and now stretches into the
                    surrounding areas, blending its historical roots with a vibrant present. While visiting Galle, donâ€™t
                    miss the iconic Galle Lighthouse, the National Maritime Museum, and the Dutch Reformed Church. The
                    bustling markets, charming cafes, and scenic beaches also add to the allure of this captivating
                    coastal town, making it a must-visit destination in Sri Lanka.</p>
