                <p>Sigiriya, also known as Lion Rock or Lion Mountain, is an ancient rock fortress located in the
                    northern Matale District near Dambulla in Sri Lanka's Central Province. According to the Cūḷavaṃsa,
                    an ancient Sri Lankan chronicle, the area was initially a large forest transformed into a hill after
                    storms and landslides. </p>

                <p>King Kashyapa (AD 477–495) selected this hill for his new capital, constructing a palace atop the
                    massive granite rock and decorating its sides with vibrant frescoes. He built an enormous
                    lion-shaped gateway on a plateau halfway up, which inspired the name "Siṃhagiri" (the Lion Rock).
                    After Kashyapa's death, the capital and palace were abandoned, and Sigiriya later functioned as a
                    Buddhist monastery until the 14th century. </p>

                <p>The rock, rising approximately 180 meters (590 feet) above the plain, features a dramatic ascent
                    through the lion's paws, one of the few remaining parts of the palace, and includes 21 rock
                    paintings of apsaras (celestial singers and dancers). Sigiriya is a UNESCO World Heritage Site,
                    celebrated for its well-preserved ancient urban planning, and continues to draw tourists worldwide
                    for its historical and archaeological significance.</p>
